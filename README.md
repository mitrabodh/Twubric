## Project Name: Twubric

### Project Info
1. The UI  displays a list of the user's Twitter followers in a grid.
2. Clicking on the date filter fields displays a date popup from which the user may select a 'From' date and a 'To' date. The aim is to allow the user to filter the list based on the dates when their followers joined Twitter. React-datepicker library was used to implement this functionality.
3. Clicking on the 'Sort by' button opens a group of tabs each of which represents a criterion. Clicking once on a criterion sorts the followers grid in ascending order by that criterion; clicking again sorts the grid in descending order by that criterion. The idea is to allow the user to view his list of followers in whichever order he chooses.
4. Clicking on the bin icon removes that follower from the list.
